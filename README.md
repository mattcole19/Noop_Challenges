## Mazebot

### Challenge Overview
The mazebot challenge essentially just randomly generates a maze with starting and ending points and has the user post a path back to it. 
You can set it to any  size you desire (with a max length of ?150) and it generates a list-of-lists it hold the layout.  You are supposed to
solve the maze then post the path you took to see your results.

### My Solution
Why would I want to spend time solving a maze when I could just make my computer do it for me?  I decided that I would create a program to
accept the maze as input and solve it for me.  Additionally, I thought it would be cool to include an animation of the maze being solved
so I used Python's Arcade library to show a little ghost sprite traverse his way about the maze from start to finish.

How did I approach the problem?
